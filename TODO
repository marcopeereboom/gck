	* add boolean type
	* type assert during compilation
	* arguments to functions
	* return values from functions
	* make interactive tvm commands a bit more sophisticated
	* add boolean operators AND, OR & NOT
	* make OS calls work
		- implement os.print
	* make the optimizer actually optimize instead of copy AST
	* do constant folding on expressions
	* add scopes to symbols
	* pretty print AST
